UI-UX Design

This is the Design of the Front End of a university parking spot booking app.
The app consists of 6 activities as follow:

Activity 1 : Loading Screen - to introduce the logo and give the app some time to connect to the database server.

Activity 2 : Sign UP Page - First time users have to sign up using the unversities sap id.

Activity 3 : Home screen - here the user can check the dash board to see how many spots are empty.
                           and whether they want to book a spot in parking space dedicated to various 
                           sub groups of people like (students , faculty , administrative staff , handicapped spots)

Activity 4 : Parking spot found - the app prompts the user with a demo map of the parking space with a star sign indicator
                                  and a location specifying text message.

Activity 5 : Release - before a user leaves the parking he/she can press the release button to change the parking spot from
                       booked to vacant.
                      
Activity 6 : Select time - Users also have the facility to book a parking spot at a particular time of arrival 
                           so that the system pre-books a spot a little before that time to avoid rush hours.
